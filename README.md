# Backup

# Simple python program for backup, works for windows.

### This tool depends on a `log file` that will contain the last backup date, and there is a `limit` variable, if the date in the `log file` equals or was bigger than the `limit` ( numbers of days you choose to start the backup again ), it will start the backup.



## Steps -

### 1- Download the code and the `log file` and pip install the modules in requirements.txt .
### 2- enter the required information in the code file such as paths and -data to ignore- and other...
### 3- run the program.


## Important -

### The only thing left is to find your own way to let this program runs whenever you turn on your pc and whenever it pass or equals the `limit` (which in days and you can edit it in the code) it will start the backup

### You mustn't edit the `log file` contents to keep the program running normally

### `log file` format :

 `YYYY-MM-DD`

### `log file` name :

`Your choice, a .txt file, or a .log file`

### `log file` path :

`Your choice`

# Backup

# Simple python program for backup, works for windows.

### This is a simple tool that backup your files anywhere you want in your drive or on your USB drive, it simply take a copy of the files and folders in the `path you choose` and paste it on `the path you choose.`

### The tool depends on a `log file` that will contain the last backup date, and there is a `limit` variable, if the date in the `log file` equals or was bigger than the `limit` ( numbers of days you choose to start the backup again ), it will start the backup.

### You can let the tool ignore folders and files you don't want to backup that is in in the same path of the data you're backing up

## Steps -

### 1- Download the code and the `log file` and pip install the modules in requirements.txt .
### 2- enter the required information in the code file such as paths and -data to ignore- and other...
### 3- run the program.


## Important -

### The only thing left is to find your own way to let this program runs whenever you turn on your pc ( automating the script )

### You mustn't edit the `log file` contents to prevent errors.

### I'm not responsible for any data loss.

### You don't need to edit the log file or do anything to it, just download the one attached with the code.

## additional info.

 `YYYY-MM-DD`

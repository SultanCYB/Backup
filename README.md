# Backup

# Simple python program for backup, works for windows.

### This tool depends on a log file that will contain the last backup date, and there is a limit variable, if the date in the log file equals or was bigger than the limit ( numbers of days you choose to backup again ), it will start the backup.



## Steps -

### 1- Download the code and the log file.
### 2- enter the required information in the code file such as paths and data to ignore and other...
### 3- run the program.


## Important -

### The only thing left is to find your own way to let this program runs whenever you turn on your pc and whenever it pass or equals the limit (which in days and you can edit it in the code) it will start the backup

### You mustn't edit the file contents or name to keep the program running normally

### I'm not responsible for any data loss.

### Log file format :

 `YYYY-MM-DD`

### Log file name :

`Your choice, a .txt file, or a .log file`
